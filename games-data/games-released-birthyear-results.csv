20134,20289,American McGee Presents Scrapland,"""Set inside a debris field thousands of miles wide is the tiny asteroid called Scrapland. Centuries of destructive exploitation by a race long gone, reduced what was once a paradise into a world inhabited only by machines. Those machines, robots of all shapes and sizes, rebuilt Scrapland into an awe-inspiring metropolis of glittering greatness.

As the robots rebuilt the world they also created a new class of citizens: policemen, bankers, priests, and civil servants. This fledgling society was transformed dramatically by the discovery of a device dubbed “The Great Database”. With it the robots could easily revive any expired or nonfunctional automaton. Death became a thing of the past.

Against this backdrop you join the story of an outsider named D-Tritus who arrives at Scrapland amid a string of bizarre murders. D-Tritus lands a job investigating the killings and eventually becomes entangled in a web of conspiracy that only his quick wits and a little help from his friends will save him from.""",2004-11-04 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,68.7215,6

He tries to build a beautiful land, but it can never reach the beauty of Heaven: the demons live in troubled times, being attacked by fallen angels who survive the fall to the Abyss, fearing the bloodshed caused by these insane former angels against them. The King starts to become weak and tired, and with his last power, he gave birth to two new hopes: a prince with golden hair born from his red right eye, and a price with silver hair born from his blue left eye.

The King decides that the two twin prices, Alex and Platina, are to fight each other, and the winner who proves his power will become the new king of Hell, while the loser will face death. As such, Alex and Platina, who never even knew each other, are thrust into a battle against each other, and the future will change depending on the outcome.

A world sustained by the Great Spirit Mana and its elemental powers.
Every substance and object in this world is formed by the elements.
People lived under the protection and guidance of the Mana.
To the people of Regallzine Mana is exist as part of nature like the wind and trees.
However, there are a few select people capable of creating something out of nothing using the powers of Mana called alchemist.

Klein Kiesling age 17, grandson of Dafune a famous alchemist, embarks on a journey with Popo the Mana of wood, after his grandmother´s death, to surpass her as an alchemist.

Walking through the dark forest of South Esvior, Klein encounters a vicious monster. Klein bravely battles the monster, but his Mana strength slowly diminishes. When everything seemed lost, a beautiful young girl named Lita came to Klein´s rescue.

Lita is a monster hunter at the neighboring town of Kavok. She advises Klein that the path to Kavok is dangerous and he will need her help. Klein rejects her advice from his selfish pride, insisting that he will make it through the forest alone. After the two depart, Klein felt ashamed for not thanking Lita for her life saving help.

Exiting out from the forest, Klein stood on a cliff overlooking the great plains of Esvior. What he saw from the cliff was a city built upon a steep mountain. The city Klein saw is the infamous city to the Esviore region, known as the city in the sky, Avenberry.

Klein and Lita do not know yet,
that the two will knock on the gates of heaven,
opening the ancient path to the legendary 'city in the sky'.""",2004-05-27 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,82.5000,3,71.2734,9

A casual traveler enters a cave as a shelter from bad weather, but we know it hides a gate to another world. A gate from where unbidden visitors may come. 
 
The dwarves are guarding the passage secret and keep peace in their world... And now the world shuddered. For the majority it is just a natural disaster. But we know: the world substance is torn, it's time to take arms, go down and stop the invaders. 
 
Your mission is to purge the dungeons from the evil and gather as much treasures as you can - it will take plenty of gold and diamonds to repair the seal on the Gate between the worlds.

189078,6189,Cave Story,"The player character awakens in a cave with no memory of how he came to be there. He finds a village of Mimigas, who are being persecuted by the Doctor. The Doctor's servants Misery and Balrog are looking for Sue Sakamoto, a girl who had been transformed into a Mimiga. Not finding her, they mistakenly abduct another Mimiga named Toroko instead. The player finds Sue in the Egg Corridor, where she discovers the eggs of a Sky Dragon, which could allow her to escape the floating island if hatched. Sue attempts to rescue her brother Kazuma, but King, the leader of Mimiga Village, captures her and holds her responsible for Toroko's kidnapping. Sue tasks the player with retrieving Kazuma from Grasstown. After freeing him, they meet Professor Booster, who reveals that the Doctor plans to use the red flowers on Mimigas to create an army to take over the surface world. Booster sends the player to the Sand Zone to destroy the red flowers before the Doctor can find them. While there, the player meets Curly Brace, a female robot who also has no memories of her past, and Jenka, an old witch who is Misery's mother and guardian of the red flowers. Jenka calls the player character a ""soldier from the surface"", one of many who were sent to the island to slaughter the Mimigas.

Misery transports the player to the Labyrinth deep inside the island as punishment for interfering with the Doctor's plans. Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimigas. In the Egg Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island's Core, which would return the Mimigas to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor's servants capture him and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that the Doctor was a member of the research expedition that included Sue's family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown. Sue directs the player to find her mother who may have a plan to stop the Doctor.

If the player saved Curly Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character's name is Quote, and that they were not the killer robots who slaughtered Mimigas in the past. Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue's mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access to the top of the island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The Doctor has purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor's spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Under certain conditions, the player may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where the creator of the Demon Crown, Ballos, is imprisoned. Ballos, Jenka's brother, was a powerful wizard who went insane after being tortured. Misery forced Ballos to create the Demon Crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. With the help of Curly Brace, Quote defeats Ballos and stops the source of the negative energy that was causing the island to fall, saving its inhabitants. Balrog saves the two before they are crushed by Ballos' collapsing prison—he had been sent by Misery as thanks for breaking her curse. Quote, Curly Brace, and Balrog leave the island to live out their days in peace.",2004-12-20 00:00:00.000,35,NULL,83.0000,3,85.0936,79

124837,11749,Codename: Gordon,"Codename: Gordon presents an alternative to the storyline of Half-Life 2, with locations inspired by both Half-Life and Half-Life 2. Along the way, Gordon Freeman — the protagonist from the canon games — meets with some of the main characters of the Half-Life series and tries to find what caused the disappearance of the third dimension.
The game starts with Gordon Freeman in a dock area. After making his way through a few zombies and headcrabs, Gordon meets with Barney Calhoun, a prominent character in the later Half-Life titles. He tells Gordon of an ""entire dimension"" missing and also notes that the science team is working on solving the problem. Being injured, Barney cannot leave the place, so he gives Gordon his pistol, telling him to leave without him.
In the second chapter, the player meets with Eli Vance and his daughter Alyx who tell Gordon to take their car, which will help him reach City 17, as seemingly it is the center of the problem. They also tell him to talk to Dr. Kleiner, about his new invention, the gravity gun. Soon after, the player finds Dr. Kleiner, who tells Gordon about his worries regarding the missing dimension and also gives him the gravity gun mentioned by Eli and Alyx.
After being attacked by an alien gunship and getting past a prison heavily guarded by Combine soldiers, Gordon manages to reach City 17, where he finds the G-Man. He tells the player he has been expecting him and claims to not be behind the situation regarding the missing dimension, instead he says he is but a ""lowly pawn in a shady game being played by sinister powers"". Soon after, Gordon confronts a strider — a large tripod assault unit — which turns out to be the source of the problem, as upon defeating it a portal is opened; stepping into this portal, Gordon is sent back to the third dimension.",2004-05-17 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,69.6844,7

With summer comes a long vacation from school.
The Broadcasting Club has been torn apart, left to slowly disintegrate.

Since returning from their first field trip of the summer, there's been a palpable distance between the club members.
Now, only one single member continues to participate in the club activities.

But a horrible realization has dawned on all of them: their school has been completely deserted. Are they really the only people left?

The hero of our story is a member of the Broadcasting Club.
He casually greets his friends as they show up at the otherwise deserted school.

On the rooftop, we find club president Misato Miyasumi assembling a massive broadcast antenna, alone.

This antenna was the club's summer project, and its completion for the purpose of sending a broadcast out to find other possible survivors has been their main goal.

Last summer, the club comprised a close-knit group of friends who worked together. Yet now, only a single member continues their efforts.

A group of the former friends watch her work, a cold glint in their eyes.
This is the story of their clashing differences rising to a boil, and the resolutions that arise from these clashes.

He asked for Donkey Kong to join him, but the hero simply continues lounging. Cranky Kong goes up to him and complains how he never took breaks, ""whisking off maidens and throwing barrels seven days a week"", but Donkey ignores him, confident that he is a hero and that King K. Rool is gone for good. Cranky soon leaves.

Meanwhile, above, Kaptain K. Rool, aboard his vessel, The Flying Krock, commands his minions to invade the island and take Donkey captive so that his next attempt at stealing the banana hoard will not be a failure and the hero will never mess with his plans again. Donkey, still lounging, did not notice the attack until Kutlasses ambushed him and took him prisoner. Kaptain K. Rool assures Donkey Kong that he will never see his precious island or his friends again.

Later and back on the island, Diddy, Dixie and Cranky Kong find Donkey missing, along with a note. It reads:
Hah-arrrrh! We have got the big monkey! If you want him back, you scurvy dogs, you'll have to hand over the banana hoard!
Kaptain K. Rool
At this point, Wrinkly, Funky and Swanky Kong come to the scene. Cranky suggests to give up the hoard, but Diddy insists that Donkey Kong would be furious if he lost his bananas after all trouble recovering them at the last time.

The various characters are each unlocked by completing a required task within Dragon Universe (for example, Dr. Gero is unlocked by defeating Dr. Gero with Yamcha in the Androids Saga).

The Dragon Universe has a high level of replayability due to events in the game potentially changing from playthrough-to-playthrough. For example, in Goku's first playthrough the majority of the story proceeds as it does according to the anime. However, in the following playthroughs, certain choices can include Goku's fight with Frieza changing into a fight with Cooler instead. These choices can even lead to events such as fighting Broly and Omega Shenron after fighting Super Buu.

The gods withdrew from the world in retaliation for mortal incursions into their planes. On Norrath itself, Dark Elves and the Orcs destroyed much of Faydwer; while the Ogres, Goblins, Orcs, and Giants ravaged Antonica. Transport and communication to the moon Luclin were cut off. The storyline says that 100 years ago, the continent of Antonica was ripped apart into smaller islands, which are now called the Shattered Lands. The oceans became impassible, preventing contact between the continents of Norrath. Fifteen years ago, the moon Luclin exploded, and parts of the shattered moon remain in the sky.

EverQuest II is set in what is called the ""Age of Destiny"" on the world of Norrath, 500 years later than the setting of the original EverQuest. The game world has been drastically affected by several cataclysms (see Story, above) since the original EverQuest. The planes have closed, the gods temporarily left, and the moon Luclin has been destroyed (and partially rained onto the face of Norrath). Remnants from the original EverQuest's Norrath can be found throughout the Shattered Lands. Players can ride trained griffons on predetermined routes over the Shattered Lands, or acquire a horse, flying carpet, warg, rhino or a floating disk so that they can travel more swiftly throughout much of the game world.",2004-11-08 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,80.6667,3,50.0000,3

178788,521,Fable,"On his sister's birthday, a young boy's village of Oakvale is raided by bandits; killing the boy's entire family. An old Hero, Maze, rescues the boy, seeing great potential in him; Maze trains the boy to become a Hero at the Heroes' Guild. Years pass; after honing his skills, Maze informs the Hero of a blind seeress living among a bandit camp near Oakvale, and advises the Hero to infiltrate the bandit camp. To the Hero's surprise, the blind seeress is actually his older sister Theresa who was taken in by Twinblade, a former Hero and the present Bandit King. After a showdown with Twinblade, the Hero is given the choice of killing or sparing the bandit.

Later on in the Hero's life, after he has gained more recognition among the people of Albion, he is invited to fight in the Arena, where he meets the legendary Hero named Jack of Blades, who runs the arena battles. As a final challenge, Jack pits the Hero against his rival, which was also once his childhood friend/room-mate back in the Guild - Whisper; when the Hero defeats her he may kill or spare her.

The Hero learns that Jack of Blades himself destroyed Oakvale during the Hero's childhood; aided by Theresa, the Hero discovers his mother alive in Bargate Prison. The Hero is captured in the rescue attempt and spends a year or more in the prison before finally escaping. Maze is revealed to be a traitor and working with Jack. Maze kidnaps Theresa. After defeating Maze, the Hero is led into a final confrontation with Jack where his mother is killed. Jack reveals that The Sword of Aeons can only be wielded if it receives the blood of Archon. The Sword of Aeons is said to be a very powerful sword of destruction. Upon the death of their mother, the Hero and Theresa are the only two remaining descendants of Archon, and if Jack destroys them both the sword will be even more powerful. After defeating Jack, the Hero must choose whether to keep the Sword of Aeons by killing his sister, or cast it away forever into a portal created by Jack of Blades' death.

Depending on the Hero's alignment and the player's choice of using or destroying the sword, there are a total of four different endings. Once the ending credits roll, players can resume their games.

In The Lost Chapters special edition, the story continues. After the defeat of Jack, the Hero must find passage to the Northern Wastes to aid a legendary hero named Scythe in stopping an unknown great evil from returning. Should the hero have discarded the Sword of Aeons he will have the opportunity to gain the sword ""Avo's Tear"", a sword of similar design and equal power but that holds a light alignment rather than dark. Avo is said to be a god that represents the light side alignment. After a series of quests revolving around this new evil, it is learned that Jack of Blades has returned. He must then defeat Jack of Blades a second time, Jack having returned from the dead in the form of a dragon. Upon the death of Jack, the hero then uses Jack's mask to capture Jack's soul, with Scythe telling him that the battle is not over and that he must destroy the mask. The hero then has the final choice of putting on the mask - being consumed by Jack in the process - or destroying it, along with Jack, forever.",2004-09-14 00:00:00.000,84,NULL,90.0000,3,84.1685,230

She sees Mayu chasing a crimson butterfly and, after following her, the two are spirited away into All God's Village (a.k.a. ""The Lost Village"" and ""Minakami Village"".)

Unknown to the twins, the village is the site of a mysterious ritual that failed, causing the village to be trapped in continuous night and to disappear from the region, destined to relive the events of the ritual's failure forever. The two sisters discover a newspaper clipping and photo of a couple on the outskirts of the village and decide to investigate before leaving by entering one of the nearby family houses after seeing a female ghost entering it. Inside they find the abandoned Camera Obscura, as well as the diaries of a woman who came to the village in search of her missing boyfriend, which the twins assume to be the ghost they viewed previously. Upon finding her final diary, the woman's ghost attacks the sisters in anger, forcing Mio to use the camera to exorcise her.

They suceed in proving him as a swindler but find the Philosopher's Stone to be fake. The brothers head back to Central to report it when the train gets hijacked by Bald 's group which threatens with a hostage. The Elric brothers rescue the hostage who reveals herself as Corniche Royce and find that the boss was merely an imitation of Bald. The Elrics learn that the girl possesses ability to use healing alchemy and is heading towards Central for State Alchemy Exam . Corniche decides to tag along Elrics as she hasn't traveled before. The train gets attacked by a Chimera and stops at a town named Viva. The trio rescues the town which is swarming with Chimeras but fail to find the culprit. They continue their journey towards the Central.

After reaching central Corniche goes to the Military Headquaters for her exam but realizes that she has forgotten her essay. While she is insisting on her participation, King Bradley appears and sets up a condition for her certification- to beat Major Alex Louis Armstrong. Corniche fails and Edward is summoned by King Bradley for Chimera's extermination in East City mission. Edward is also given a permission to form a 'Special Squad'. After much insistence from Al and Hughes Edward agrees to recruit Major Armstrong and Colonel Roy Mustang in the special squad though he despises the idea of working with the two. The party takes Major Armstrong from the Central and heads towards the East City where Colonel is assigned and mission to be executed, but on their way the train gets hi-jacked again by real Bald's group who threaten with the life of all passengers. The party defeats the culprits and reach the East City and travel directly towards the Colonels office.

Colonel Mustang refuses to join and leaves for a surveil which makes Edward more determined to recruit him. The party chases Mustang and challenges him with a fight to decide his enlistment. After being defeated Colonel is forced to join and Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye volunteers to help for Colonel's safety. State Alchemist Lieutenant Colonel Aston Martins also known as The Thunder Alchemist is enlisted upon Mustang's insistence. Mustang leaves his paperwork on East City Chimera's case to Havoc and heads towards Redendo along with the rest of the party.

The party solves the robbery case at Redendo but comes empty handed with their true assignment. Back at the East Military Headquaters Party learns about a case of two people described as one short and one in armor causing disturbance at a town named Solin. Hoping that it would lead to some kind of clue to Chimera case and dubious of perpetuators identity party travels to Solin. There the party learns that the people causing trouble indeed look like Elric Brothers and infact call themselves Elrics too. Infuriated with their name being disgraced again by imposters, the Elrics decide to catch the charlatans. Once they capture and defeat the imposters, the party learns that are merely alchemist created manikins again and the alchemist is no other than a young girl aged 16 who reveals her name to be Cate Rham. Cate makes a brief encounter with the party and then flees saying that they'll again someday. With the fakes revealed and still clueless about the Chimera's case the party returns to the East Headquarters again.

Once back at the East Headquarters the party learns about an eccentric alcehmist living in a mansion who is assumed to possess skills in body alchemy. Suspicious, the party head towards hermit's mansion and learns that the strange man is indeed involved in Chimera's case, but before they can arrest him, they are attacked by a Chimera and the suspect flees. Colonel contacts the HQ and learns that the man is named Dalt Daimler and he's heading towards Edward and Alphonse hometown Resembool .

The party fails to find Dalt in Resembool but Ed gets his maintenance. The party head towards ruins near Resembool where Dalt is likely to be. While chasing Dalt the party meets up with two of the Homunculi: Lust and Gluttony whom they defeat. After defeating the Homunculi Edward mentions his suspicion to Alphonse about Philosophers Stone presence in ruins as the homunculus were around. However, the brothers agree to keep this theory a secret. The party finds Dalt corpse which is missing a bag that Dalt was carrying. The party moves on to find out the murderer who turns out to be Randy the robber at Redondo. The party defeats Randy and starts to interrogate him about the surrounding situation before Cate intervenes along with a masked alchemist named Lincor whom Colonel Martin seems to know as Licor takes Dalt's bag from Randy and uses a tremendous power to unleashe a powerful attack on the party and earn enough time to escape with his group. Ed conjectures that Licor was using a Philosopher's stone in Dalt's bag to wield such power.

Meanwhile, Mustang and Martin discuss that how strangely Linor's presence resembles that of State Alchemist Colonel Seraphy Royce. Mustang tells Ed about Seraphy Royce's history who was a healing State Alchemist [The Tuning Alchemist] whose qualification was about to be taken from him before he was reported dead in Ishval War. The trio suspects if he was the one responsible for recent Chimera's outbreak and if Corniche Royce is really Lincor's sister.

The party receives information about Licors hideout in East City Sewers and goes there. Though it's unable to find Lincor, the party encounters Lincor's associates Cate and Randy again and a a man with a scar on his forehead who vaguely claims to pass down the god 's judgement . Colonel Martin is reluctant to fight his 'old friend' so he suggests the party to retreat as they are unlikely to find Lincor.

As the party is heading towrds HQ, when it learns about Chimeras assault on HQ from Hughes. The party exterminates Chimera's from the base mainly to safe Mustang's address book in his office. While still in Mustang's office, the party further discuuses Lincor's case where Corniche learns about her possible relevence to Lincor. Ed encourages her to believe in her brother which Corniche accepts to do. After the party rescues the HQ, Mustang gets caught up in restoration paperwork with Riza by his side. Other miliraty members also get engaged leaving Ed, Al, Corniche and Colonel Martin (as their bodyguard) to have a break. The group decides to spend the night at Inn. At that night Martin asks Edward his reason for being the Dog of the Military. Edward explains about his failed human transmutation and his determination to restore his younger brother's body back. Corniche tells the brothers that she believes they'll suceed in achieving their goals and then the group has a dinner.

The next day, the group decides to head back to HQ as there might be new info on Lincor's case. The whole party assembles again and head out to a castle in southeast where Lincor's sightings have been reported. The party meets Lust, Randy,and Cate again all of whom they defeat again separately. On there way to meet Lincor Mustang mentions his suspicion on Martin who openly refuses the charge. The party finally catches up with Lincor. Ed provkes Lincor to reveal the Philosopher Stone in the bag but Lincor opens the bag and unleashes a giant ultimate Chimera instead. The Chimera keeps regenerating .With no other option at sight, Martin sacrifices his own life to defend his party.

With a dear friend sacrificed, Ed gets agitated and questions Lincors motives to hurt his very own friend and sister to which Lincor answers by saying that something valuable is a necessary price to protect something and Martin was fool not to understand that. Ed attacks Lincor who drops a locket which holds his and Corniche's photo. Corniche questions Lincor if he really is her brother who would hold the words 'Alchemist, Be Thou for the People' dear but Linor bluntly refuses of having any recollection of her and violently attacks the party. The party defeats Lincor but he refuses to give up. Ed sums up all the events and concludes that the power Lincor possess is not by using the Philosopher's Stone but by trading his precious memories with his sister.

Licor makes one last attempt to annihilate the party by merging himself with the whole castle. Corniche remembering Martins words to stay strong to be State Alchemist heals the whole party which emerges victorious again. Lincor recalls his remaining memories of his mother and feeling that he traded everything for peoples' welfare dies comfortably. The party once again heads back to HQ.
Back at HQ, the party recovers from their former friend's death and Corniche is finally allowed to retake State Alchemy Exam. Corniche passes the exam and earns her brother's title 'The Tuning Alchemist'. She gladly accepts it and decides that she would recompense for her brother's wrongdoings. The story comes to an end with Corniche separating from the Elric brothers for her hometown and everyone else settling back their normal lives.",2004-03-25 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

176530,1632,GoldenEye: Rogue Agent,"At the start of the game, a recording by M (head of MI6) reveals that: ""Three years ago, while on assignment, the agent was severely wounded in an encounter with Dr. No and subsequently lost the use of his right eye. Consumed with vengeance, he frequently resorts to violence and brutality, and is no longer fit for service with MI6."" According to the account, Dr. No shot the agent in his right eye during a mission.
Three years after the incident that claimed the agent's right eye, he is evaluated through a holographic simulation in which he is paired with 007 to stop Auric Goldfinger, a member of a criminal organization, from detonating a suitcase nuke inside Fort Knox. He fails the test and is held directly responsible for the ""death"" of 007. Charged with ""reckless brutality,"" he is dismissed from MI6. As he leaves the headquarters, he is seen reading an offer by Goldfinger to enlist in his organization.
The agent accepts Goldfinger's offer and is recruited as his enforcer, meeting with him at Auric Enterprises, where Goldfinger's scientists have developed a weapon known as the OMEN (Organic Mass Energy Neutralizer), which releases energy capable of breaking down organic matter on a nearly atomic level, resulting in disintegration. For his job of eliminating Dr. No, a fellow official of the criminal organization who has declared war on Goldfinger's branch of the organization, he is given a gold-hued cybernetic eye created by Francisco Scaramanga, another official of Goldfinger's organization (from which he receives his codename ""GoldenEye""). Scaramanga provides upgrades for the eye, starting with MRI vision. At Hong Kong, GoldenEye has to get a sniper rifle to take down Dr. No with the EM hack feature. At the Midas Casino, GoldenEye has to get to the vault (which can be found in multiplayer) to protect the OMEN with the magnetic polarity shield. At the Hoover Dam, GoldenEye has to destroy the dam and kill Xenia Onatopp. GoldenEye also tosses Oddjob over a rail into a pit inside the Hoover Dam after he betrays and attacks GoldenEye for unknown reasons. At The Octopus, GoldenEye has to download the navigation coordinates to Crab Key (Dr. No's base) with the help of the generated force field from his golden eye. He is eventually sent to Crab Key, where he confronts Dr. No. During their duel, GoldenEye uses his mechanical eye to sabotage the island's nuclear reactor, causing it to electrocute Dr. No. Upon No's death, Goldfinger contacts GoldenEye and informs him that he believes he is too dangerous to be left alive, and that he had contacted GoldenEye earlier and told him to activate a program which would shut down the Lair's defense grid. Goldfinger reveals that he is intent on taking over the Lair, and leaves GoldenEye to die in the impending nuclear meltdown. GoldenEye, however, manages to escape in Dr. No's osprey before the reactor overloads and the island is destroyed in a large explosion.
GoldenEye returns to the Lair intent on confronting Goldfinger. Pussy Galore rendezvous with GoldenEye and informs him that Goldfinger has used the OMEN to wipe out most of the Lair's guards, and taken control of it. Scaramanga provides the mechanical eye with a computer virus that he can use to overload the OMEN.
GoldenEye fights his way through the Lair, implanting the computer virus in the process, eventually reaching the area where Goldfinger and the OMEN are. Goldfinger traps GoldenEye inside a chamber that he claims will soon be devoid of oxygen. The computer virus then activates the OMEN, causing it to explode in a burst of energy, killing Goldfinger and his troops. GoldenEye and Galore leave the Lair aboard Galore's chopper, and Scaramanga and Number One (Ernst Stavro Blofeld) later discuss what to do with GoldenEye and decide to simply see what he does next before proceeding.",2004-11-22 00:00:00.000,5,NULL,63.3333,4,43.6149,13

191851,1530,Jak 3,"The game begins with Jak and Daxter being banished into the Wasteland by the tyrannical Count Veger for supposed crimes against Haven City. Ashelin, who opposes the banishment, gives Jak a beacon before she leaves and tells him to ""stay alive"". As they travel through the desert, flashbacks reveal that Haven City is at war between the Freedom League and the surviving Metal Heads and their allies, the KG Death Bots. The Palace is then destroyed by an unknown force. As Jak, Daxter, and Pecker lose consciousness, they are rescued by a group of desert-dwellers, who take them back to Spargus City.

Waking up in Spargus, the King, Damas, says that Jak must earn his place in the civilization by proving himself as a warrior in both the Arena challenges and by serving the city, who his ""life now belongs to"" for being rescued. His missions involve recovering artifacts after sandstorms, racing for both buggies and Leaper lizards for upgrades, Eco crystals and buggies, catching Kanga rats upon a Leaper lizard, and several other odd jobs in the oasis city. Most important among these events is that Jak is bestowed Light Eco abilities to balance the darkness within, granted to him at the Precursor temple by an oracle who believes that Jak is the last hope for the civilization. These powers include time-slowing abilities, healing powers, shield abilities, and even flight. Along the way, Jak befriends the Precursor Monk, Seem, and a buggy garage owner, Kliever – who initially dislike him until he gains their trust over time. During one of Damas' missions into the desert, Jak is found by Ashelin, who reveals that she knew Damas would find him since she knew he would check his old beacons. She refuses to tell him how she knows Damas and then begs Jak to come back to Haven City to defend it from the Metal Heads and the new Krimzon Guard Deathbots. Still embittered about being exiled, he refuses to return. Ashelin leaves him, but later, after finding out what the evil Count Veger has in store for his friends, Jak changes his mind and makes the journey via transport to Haven City. Jak and Daxter help reunite the resistance in Haven, who is divided due to barriers put up by enemies, and give them hope that they can beat back the Metal Heads and Deathbots.",2004-11-09 00:00:00.000,41,NULL,70.0000,3,75.5673,131

For 3,300 years, the nation of Hwan was the master of the world and the king of Hwan, Guhbalkhan establishes a huge country called Naraeha that the size of the territory is 12,000 miles to the north & south with 5,000 miles to the west & east.

14th King, Hanin Rules The Sky
14th king Hanin accedes to the throne and new sky has been open. Since the nation lost its power by long drought and civil wars in the time of king Guhbalkhan, they were attacked from foreign enemies continuously. Especially, the Tow tribe and the Hwasan tribe. They broke the agreement of not to invade each other, and attacked Naraeha. The king Hanin was angry with their attack and he mobilizes his entire troops with being fully equipped. The troops of Hanin and the king himself attacked back the troops of Hwasan tribe. Hanin occupied Dangsang on that battle and it's called the great battle of Dangsang. After the great battle of Dangsang all the colonies surrendered but the tribe of Tow never gave up and the great warrior of Tow attacked Hanin with his troops that are twice as big as Hanin's troops. However, he also could not win from Hanin's great tactics and the civil war has ended.

Insurrection of Bango
When the civil war ended, Naraeha developed rapidly; they made new steel weapons for national power, built tunnels and made roads for transportation.

The King of Demons
At the end of the North he met the king of the demons who has lost his body at the Canyon of the Dead Man and he made a contract with the demon king for making his revenge to Ha-Nin. After the contract, Ban-Go is reborn as the demon king and he attacks Naraeha with the troops of the demon.

Meanwhile, Kirby is taking a walk when Dark Meta Knight appears. Before Kirby can react, Dark Meta Knight slices Kirby in four and Kirby becomes four different colored Kirbys. They chase after Dark Meta Knight on a Warp Star simultaneously and enter the Mirror World.

Kirby then proceeds to fight Dark Mind, the true mastermind behind the Mirror World's corruption, multiple times. Upon defeat, the Mirror World is saved, and Shadow Kirby (the Mirror World counterpart of Kirby who is believed to be an enemy, but is now an ally) waves his goodbyes to the four Kirbys as they all exit the Mirror World one by one.

In the year 22XX AD, a mysterious mineral known as Force Metal was extracted from the fragments of a meteor that landed in the Pacific Ocean. Technology based on the metal revolutionized the field of Reploid engineering. The Federation built Giga City, an artificial island, near the meteor site for the explicit purpose of mining and smelting Force Metal.

Everything seemed to go well, until a band of renegade Reploids armed themselves and launched a rebellion on the island. They banished all humans and demanded that the government recognize Giga City as an independent Reploid state. This new Rebellion Army and its leader, Epsilon, were all branded Mavericks for this deed.

After the first team of Maverick Hunters was annihilated or otherwise subdued by the Rebellion Army, Colonel Redips sent in a special team composed of X, Zero, and Shadow. If they failed their mission - arrest Epsilon and quell the Reploid insurrection - the Federation would have no choice but to declare all-out war on Giga City and the Rebellion Army.

Chapter 1: Infiltrate Giga City!
X, Zero, and Shadow teleport to the outskirts of Giga City to investigate an energy reading in the Lagrano Ruins. The trio are separated by a mysterious explosion, but they continue towards the top of the structure. X and Zero meet up near the top when they are suddenly attacked by Hippopressor, which they destroy.

Upon making it to the roof, X and Zero find Shadow faced with Epsilon. They begin to arrest Epsilon, but Shadow turns on them, revealing his true allegiance to the Rebellion Army. The Rebellion cadres - Scarface, Botos, and Ferham - also reveal themselves, and the Hunters realize that they've been led into an ambush. Zero attempts to strike Epsilon, but is overpowered and sent flying by the cadres attacks. Now alone, X finds himself with no other choice but to flee, leaping off the roof and into a chasm below. Ferham begins to give chase, but Epsilon stops her, well-aware that X will return.",2004-07-29 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,57.7602,9

The Spirits, foreseeing the inevitable destruction of Earth due to the ravages of our time, directed scientific efforts into the discovery of a new plane of existence: the Psychosphere. The Psychosphere acted as a conduit, providing means to reach another, untouched world, a new Promised Land, by jumping between flat worlds within the Psychosphere. The Psychosphere is appropriately named, as the various worlds resemble the thoughts and actions that have occurred upon Earth during its history. The Spirits then embarked upon the construction of massive floating city-ships called Frames, which could house hundreds of thousands of people for an indefinite period of time. With the Frames completed, the Spirits sent them forth into the Psychosphere with the intent to lead their people to the Promised Land, leaving Earth behind forever.",2004-05-21 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,86.0000,2,50.0000,3

The Prince seeks counsel from an old wise man who explains that whoever releases The Sands of Time must die. Because the Prince escaped his fate, it is the Dahaka's mission as guardian of the Timeline to ensure that he dies as he was meant to. The old man also tells of the Island of Time, where the Empress of Time first created the Sands. The Prince sets sail for the Island in an attempt to prevent the Sands from ever being created, an act he believes will appease the Dahaka. After a battle at sea with an enemy force led by a mysterious woman in black capsizes the Prince's ship, the Prince washes ashore unconsciously onto the Island of Time.
He later awakens and chases the woman in black through the Empress of Time's fortress into a portal that transports the two into the past. The Prince saves a woman named Kaileena from being killed by the woman in black, whose name is Shahdee. Unable to grant the Prince an audience with the Empress of Time, who is busy preparing to create the Sands, Kaileena instead tells him how to unlock the door to the throne room in which the Empress resides. The Prince makes his way through the fortress, utilizing the sand portals to travel back and forth between the past and present, and narrowly escapes several encounters with the Dahaka, who he discovers cannot pass through water. The Prince activates the mechanisms in the two towers of the fortress - the Garden Tower and the Mechanical Tower - that serve as locks to the door. He returns to the throne room only to discover that Kaileena is actually the Empress of Time herself, who has foreseen in the Timeline that the Prince will kill her and who has decided to attempt to defy her fate, just as the Prince is doing. A battle ensues and the Prince proves victorious; he kills Kaileena and returns to the present. What lies ahead is the most dramatic Twist in the Prince's life, and He starts believing the priest who told him ""You cant change your Fate! No Man Can.."" But Prince is not going to give up that easily.",2004-11-30 00:00:00.000,147,NULL,79.6000,7,83.0244,389

The unprincipled youths enjoyed playing games with each other, battling their egos and absorbing the power of the other. On the other hand, there are those who don't like the fact that the possessor of an ego invisible to ordinary people is on the loose.

Ryo Matsuura has lived his whole life without knowing what happened to him, but before long he too became able to see the Ego. However, with the help of his best friend Shuji Fushimi, who is also an egoist, he is able to escape. As soon as he gets used to his new environment, Yae Shibaura gives him a powerful power, and Ryo is forced to think about what to do with himself.

Ryo's understanding of ego is deepened as he helps Shuji hunt down a psychic who plays with it. However, he is horrified to find out that his estranged lover, Hotaru Ashida, is also under the spell of the psychic who is after him. On the other hand, Shuji continues to work alone without informing Ryo, and in the process, he gets to know a solitary girl, Saya Miyaji.

One day, Yae, who is supposed to be dead, appears in front of Ryo and tells him that she wants to talk to Shuji. Ryo is troubled and tells Shuji about it, but when Shuji meets Yae, he decides that what she is trying to do is dangerous. Shuji challenges Yae to a fight on his own, loses, and never wakes up again. Ryo confirms his love for Hotaru, who still cares for him in spite of the danger, and decides to face Yae himself. Satoko and Naomi, who are fascinated by her, try to block Ryo's way, but Haruaki and Saya join them and let him go first.

Yae confronts Ryo and tells him that she has taken countless egos into her body and will realise them for the sake of everyone's happiness. Stripped of the power she has given him, Ryo's ego reverts to its pre-growth form, but his determination to run as far as he can finally reaches Yae. But it is a path from which there is no turning back, and the two disappear in a blaze of glory. As Hotaru waits for Ryo's return, she receives a final message from him on her mobile phone.",2004-04-23 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The actual tournament follows over five days in which cut sequences telling the character's story are interspersed with matches.

The second day always features a mud match, and the fourth is usually a match of special significance, involving a shocking revelation or an encounter with a rival. The climax comes in a final boss fight against the mysterious Lady X and the resolution of the character's story. 
 
Defeating Lady X unlocks a new alternate story mode, featuring the characters alter-ego. It may be supposed that this takes place some time later after the character has 'turned'. In this mode, there are cut sequences only at the start and finish of the character's story. In between she fights a number of matches against various opponents (including one mud wrestling). The final match begins with a cut sequence, and is usually against a special rival (though in a few cases its Lady X again) and winning this match completes the story.

Combining ancient legends and mythic storytelling with historical fact, Seal of Evil sets the stage for an epic adventure wherein the players struggle to thwart the Qin invasion of their peaceful homeland, East Baiyue. Ferocious beasts, merciless enemy soldiers, wicked bandits, and terrifying supernatural foes are hazards they must face in order to achieve this goal.

When they arrive, the demon is revealed to be Yuri from the previous game. Nicolai casts a curse on Yuri; this severely weakens Yuri, but also reveals Nicolas as a member of Sapientes Gladio, a faction of dark sorcerers seeking world domination.

Yuri escapes with Karin and they build a small party of allies to thwart Nicolas' plan. Nicolai, a bastard son of Tsar Nicolas II, hopes to take over Russia with the help of Rasputin, the current leader of Sapientes Gladio. Yuri manages to recover his strength with the help of a former Sapientes Gladio sorcerer, Jovis, though his memory is still affected by Nicolai's curse. The group then finds and defeats Rasputin and Nicolai. Before Nicolai can be finished off, however, he is rescued by Kato, a Japanese Envoy and old friend of Yuri's, and taken to Japan.

In Japan, the party tracks Nicolai to a research lab, where he is possessed by a demon. After learning where he is, the party tracks him, but not before Kato's wife is killed. In despair, Kato attempts to remake the world using his own sorcery, forcing Yuri and his party to put him down

The game has two possible endings. In the “bad” ending, Yuri's personality and memories are erased by Nicolai's curse, and he spends the rest of his life under the care of Roger Bacon, his old friend. In the “good” ending, Yuri chooses to die so that he doesn't lose his memories and personality to the curse. He then finds himself at the beginning of the previous game. In both endings, Karin travels back to 1887 and is revealed to be Anne, Yuri's mother.",2004-02-19 00:00:00.000,9,NULL,81.0000,3,80.8399,22

Inspector Carmelita Montoya Fox and her new partner, Constable Neyla, confront Sly, but he escapes before Carmelita and Neyla can arrest him. Before making his escape, Sly hears Neyla suggest that the evidence actually suggests that the Klaww Gang stole the parts for their own use.

The Cooper Gang heads to Paris, where the first Klaww Gang member Dimitri is using Clockwerk tail feathers as printing plates to create counterfeit money. Sly and the gang shut the operation down and Dimitri is arrested by Interpol. The gang then heads to India, where the second Klaww Gang member Rajan puts Clockwerk's wings on display at a ball he is hosting. Rajan is also the kingpin of a local crime syndicate that grows and sells ""spice"", an illegal plant indigenous to the Indian jungle. Also present at the ball are the other Klaww Gang members and several undercover Interpol agents, including Carmelita and Neyla. The gang steals the Clockwerk wings in the middle of the ballroom while a disguised Sly creates a distraction by dancing with Carmelita. After the Cooper gang escapes with the Clockwerk wings, Carmelita blows her cover and starts making arrests. The Klaww Gang flees the scene, and Rajan goes into hiding somewhere deep in the jungle. The gang tracks him to his spice-growing facility in a long-abandoned temple, where he is using half of Clockwerk heart to super-irrigate his spice crops. He carries the other half of the heart on the end of a staff that he carries with him at all times. The gang steals both halves of the heart and incapacitates Rajan, but Carmelita, Neyla and the Contessa arrive. Neyla frames Carmelita of working with the Cooper Gang on the night the Clockwerk wings were stolen. She betrays the Cooper Gang and puts Sly, Murray, and Carmelita under arrest.",2004-09-14 00:00:00.000,37,NULL,80.0000,4,84.5025,108

162974,6599,Sonic Advance 3,"Prior to the game's events, Doctor Eggman builds a robotic assistant named Gemerl, using parts from the robot Emerl who was destroyed in Sonic Battle. Eggman attempts an experiment using the Chaos Emeralds to perform the Chaos Control technique, but it goes awry and tears the world apart. This action separates Sonic and Tails from Amy, Knuckles, and Cream, all of whom Eggman finds and captures, intending to create a segment of his impending empire on each chunk of the planet. Sonic and Tails travel through the game's seven levels to recapture their friends and retrieve the Emeralds.

The final boss fight takes place at the Altar Emerald temple. If the player defeats Eggman there without having all seven Chaos Emeralds, Eggman and Gemerl escape and fall off the edge of the temple. Peace is restored to the world, and Omochao snaps a picture of the five heroes. However, the game alerts the player that the Emeralds must still be collected for the true ending. If the player defeats Eggman at the temple with all the Chaos Emeralds, Gemerl stops running away with Eggman and attacks Sonic, causing the Emeralds to scatter. Gemerl uses them to take on a giant, orb-shaped form, but Sonic also uses their power to attain his Super Sonic form. With Eggman's help, Super Sonic destroys Gemerl. Tails later finds Gemerl's broken body on a beach, repairing and reprogramming it. The game ends as Cream plays with the now non-aggressive Gemerl at her mother Vanilla's house.",2004-06-07 00:00:00.000,8,NULL,72.0000,2,71.4087,46

The Turtles chase the trail down to a building marked ""T.C.R.I."", which proves to hide a bizarre secret beneath its innocuous exterior: its employees are members of a brain-like alien race, the Utroms. Whilst battling these strange new foes, the Turtles are accidentally teleported to different points across the galaxy, meeting the Fugitoid Professor Honeycutt on D'Hoonib, and end up as crossfire in the war between the Triceratons and Federation - both sides are after the Fugitoid for his technology. Along the way, they come across an intergalactic bounty hunter named Slashuur. Said to be the most powerful bounty hunter in the universe, Honeycutt heard legends of him as a young child. Ironically, Honeycutt is who Slashuur is after, having been hired by the Triceratons to capture him. After the Turtles beat him, Slashuur reveals that he has knowledge of Hamato Yoshi before taking his leave. Before escaping the Triceraton Homeworld, the Turtles befriend and free a noble Triceraton warrior who had been forced to fight as a gladiator, Traximus.

Upon returning to Earth and the T.C.R.I. building, it is revealed that the Utroms had rescued an injured Splinter and were caring for him. The Utroms place the TMNT and Splinter in a virtual reality machine to better explain their origins to them. Hundreds of years ago, the Utroms were traveling across the galaxy, transporting a murderous rogue of their species, Ch'rell. Their ship crashes on Earth in the country of Japan. Ch'rell escapes, while the Utroms are forced to wait for Earth technology to catch up with their own, so they can return home. Some time later, after the Utroms have enlisted the help of some humans as Guardian Ninja, the Utroms are ambushed by a heavily armored warlord known as The Shredder. Meanwhile, in the real world, Baxter Stockman sabotages the virtual reality machine, and the dangers within become presented as real to the Turtles and Splinter. After defeating Shredder and his Feudal Foot Ninja, the Turtle meet up with the Utrom Mortu, who gives them a device that allows them to return to the real world. Unfortunately, when they get there, they find Shredder and the Foot attacking the T.C.R.I. building. During their fight, an organic destruction device is planted, and the Utrom escape through their Transmat.

The Turtles later encounter a gigantic anthropomorphic alligator in the sewers by the name of Leatherhead. After a scuffle, Leatherhead realizes he and the Turtles are on the same side. He tells his own origin; that he was once a baby gator, found by an Utrom and adopted. Leatherhead came into contact with some Retromutagen Ooze, and became as he is currently, just as the Turtles had. He lived with the Utroms, considering them his family. When the T.C.R.I. building exploded, he fled to the sewers and took up residence in the Turtles' old lair, attempting to build a Transmat of his own to follow the Utroms. Unfortunately, it is revealed that his partner in this endeavor was none other than Baxter Stockman, feigning alliance with the Utroms. Baxter, realizing his jig was up, threw a chemical tank and fled, causing the ceiling of Leatherhead's lair to collapse. Leatherhead urges his new friends to escape while he held the collapsing rubble.

""What a pathetic wretch... You worthless coward!""

The battle between Heihachi and Jin began. Jin defeated Heihachi. Filled with anger, his black wings spread, Just as Heihachi thought he was doomed, Jin regained control of himself.

""Thank my mother, Jun Kazama."" Jin said as he took flight.

The sounds of battle gave way to silence as Heihachi lay spread out on the ground. The silence was soon interrupted by approaching aircraft. The roar of the aircraft increased and the sound of something being ejected was heard. A group of Jack-4s crashed through the ceiling. At first, Heihachi suspected that Kazuya was responsible for the intrusion but realized that Kazuya was just as bewildered by the sudden attack.

""Why are you here?"" tells Heihachi as the wave of Jack 4s approaches. Heihachi and Kazuya team up and battle waves of Jack 4s but reinforcements appear as fast as the Jacks are destroyed.

Heihachi starts to lose his breath. Kazuya then betrays Heihachi, throwing him into the middle of the army of Jacks, and uses the opportunity to escape from Honmaru. Shortly after, Honmaru is devastated by a huge explosion and Heihachi goes flying, landing in a graveyard

On an airplane close by, the battle is watched by a man dressed in black. He raises his hand to his ear and speaks into his radio.

""Heihachi Mishima is dead...""

At that moment, a Jack attacks from behind but it cut in half instantly as the man disappears.

Hon-Maru is completely destroyed, a raging inferno in its place. A pile of debris was blown apart as something emerged from the earth, unseen.

The next day, news of Heihachi Mishima's death spread rapidly across the globe. Most people believed that Heihachi's death would bring about the end of the Mishima Zaibatsu, but behind the scenes someone else had taken control, and business went on as usual.

He appears to be trapped and left for dead. Ayame stuck Rikimaru's sword, ""Izayoi"" (he is seen drawing this sword in the opening CG of Wrath of Heaven) in snow as a monument for her fellow ninja, now considered dead. A year later, Rikimaru reports to Lord Gohda that he has managed to survive this near-death experience; unbeknownst to them, the real Rikimaru is trapped in the 20th century trying to find a way back to their time.

The game's plot plays differently depending on the character chosen, but connects at certain points. The story revolves mainly around Rikimaru's return and the struggle for the Three Jewels, which are said to give power to those who possess them. These are the Jewels of Heaven, Earth, and Virtue. Tenrai, an evil wizard who wants to get his hands on them, commands a band of his men to take the Jewels from whoever possesses them. However, upon encountering Rikimaru, he seems interested in his power and attempts convincing him to join his men. Rikimaru refuses, and he and Ayame face each one of them. One of the men in Tenrai's arsenal is Onikage, who only serves him to pursue his plan of reviving Mei-Oh (his former master) and Tatsumaru (the former leader of the Azuma Ninja Clan whom Tenrai revived). Rikimaru and Ayame follow Tenrai into his fortress to stop him from destroying the world using the power gained from two of the Jewels.

You must save your village from marauders who are but pawns in the struggle to capture Shadowmage Skelos Undriel -- a piece in a darker and more sinister game. You'll journey through rugged terrain, despoiled temples, bandit lairs, and murderous caverns. You'll fight many foes in your search for the power of the Shadowkeys and the Star Teeth, and your journey will lead you to the Crypt of the Heart where you'll face the ultimate test.

Shadowmage Skelos Undriel is on the run from Battlemage Jagar Tharn, driven from the heart of Tamriel by Tharn's agents, who are in dogged pursuit. Undriel chooses to flee to the Western Reach, an area in the throes of The War of the Bend'r-mahk between High Rock, Hammerfell and Skyrim. The Shadowmage hides himself in the chaos swirling about Dragonstar. Skelos Undriel then hatches a desperate scheme to collect the Star Teeth sown about the region hoping their power is sufficient to thwart Tharn's agents, and perhaps even destroy the Battlemage himself.",2004-11-24 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

177654,1035,The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,"One year, in celebration of when the Picori last came to Hyrule 100 years ago to the day, the festival was unusually grand. Hyrule Castle was hosting a tournament of sword-fighting skill that calls to mind the heroes of legend. That year’s champion was a mysterious man by the name of Vaati. He won the tournament with an almost magical ease, and all of Hyrule was abuzz with rumors about this shadowy figure. The young Link, who attends the festival that year with his childhood friend, Princess Zelda, is charged by his grandfather, Smith, with delivering the sword that will be presented to the champion.

During the ceremony following the sword competition, Vaati shatters the sacred Picori Blade and opens the Bound Chest, which, for an age, had been sealed by the Picori Blade, trapping evil monsters within. Vaati is after the Light Force, the golden light that was once wielded by the Hero of Men mentioned in the legends of the Picori. He subdues the castle guards and turns Princess Zelda to stone before departing. Vaati was once a Minish, an apprentice of the Minish sage Ezlo. Ezlo had made a magical Cap with the power to grant wishes, but Vaati had stolen it and used it to become a powerful sorcerer. He had transformed Ezlo into a hat himself, then proceeded to hunt down the Light Force. Link is asked by King Daltus to seek out the Picori and ask them to reforge the sacred blade, and he travels to the Minish Woods with the help of his Map.

There he meets Ezlo, a curious creature whom he rescues from a group of Red Octoroks. Ezlo hops onto his head and offers to help him find the Picori. He also helps Link shrink down to a minuscule size — the size of the Picori people, who call themselves the Minish. Link meets with Gentari, the elder of the Minish Village, who tells him that in order to reforge the sacred Picori Blade, he will need the Four Elements, the embodiment of the sacred powers of earth, fire, water, and wind. Vaati had learned from the legend of the Wind Tribe that when the Four Elements were collected, the path to the Light Force will open. Knowing that Link is collecting them, Vaati decides to wait until the task is complete.

Once Link has gathered the Four Elements, he brings the Picori Blade — renamed the White Sword by Melari, a Minish sword-smith — to the Elemental Sanctuary hidden within the courtyard of Hyrule Castle. There he infuses the White Sword with the Four Elements, fully restoring the sacred Four Sword — a legendary blade with the power to split one warrior into four. Link then gains access to a chamber with stained glass, where the location of the Light Force is revealed to be within Princess Zelda.

Meanwhile, Vaati has brainwashed King Daltus and shrouded Hyrule Castle in darkness. He discovers from the stained glass of the chamber inside the Elemental Sanctuary that the sacred Light Force had actually been passed down through Hyrule’s princesses, and so he prepares to extract it from Princess Zelda. Link rushes to her rescue, and, after vanquishing Vaati, uses the Four Sword’s evil-banishing power to restore Princess Zelda.

With Vaati defeated, the Mage's Cap could be used to restore Hyrule. Princess Zelda puts on the cap and wishes with all her heart that Vaati’s cruelty might be undone. With her righteous wish and the power of the Light Force that still dwelt within her, many miracles happen as a result.

Now that the land of the humans had been saved, Ezlo ventures back into the world of the Minish through the Minish Door, not to return until perhaps the next time, one hundred years later, when the doorway to their world would open once more.",2004-11-04 00:00:00.000,90,NULL,90.0000,1,84.1893,292

9486,224,The Sims 2,"The game starts at the neighborhood level. Here you can create a housing development from scratch or start with one of three pre-made neighborhoods, each with its own theme. From there, you'll settle on a house and a family of Sims to control. Sims now have aspirations, wants, and fears. The wants and fears are the day-to-day things that occupy their minds, like wanting to see friends or get married and fearing death or being rejected for a kiss. Satisfy their wants, and they become more efficient at completing tasks you assign them. Realize their fears, and Sims become lethargic, cranky, and unresponsive to your commands. Aspirations are the big-picture things, like raising a family, becoming wealthy, and gaining knowledge. Succeed here and you'll be able to buy odd gifts for your Sim to improve his or her life, like a money tree that pays dividends or a ""fountain of youth"" water cooler.

Of course, you wouldn't be able to juggle all that if it weren't for the improved ""Free Will"" option, which makes it easier for Sims to fulfill their basic needs. The artificial intelligence of the game is noticeably improved; they won't turn on radios just as a family member is going to bed but, strangely, they do occasionally put their dishes on the floor.

Another big change in the series is the concept of the lifespan. Now Sims are born with the traits of their parents, families grow, and Sims grow old. Not only does this go hand in hand with aspirations (growing up is the first aspiration that a baby Sim will have), it provides a limited time with which your Sims can achieve their goals.

The pre-made households all have backstories that are smart spoofs of soap-opera plots--lots of scheming, romance, ghosts, and family fighting.",2004-09-14 00:00:00.000,118,NULL,71.0000,7,78.9028,391

Along the way, they encounter a firefly (Wriggle Nightbug) and a night sparrow (Mystia Lorelei), who are quickly defeated. Next, they meet a half-beast (Keine) who is protecting a Human Village from youkai. She mistakes the team for enemies and attacks them. After the team defeats her, Keine indicates that the person who switched the moons is in the bamboo forest. In the bamboo forest, they encounter a character (either Reimu or Marisa) who demands to know why the team has been freezing time and causing an imperishable night.

Finally the team reaches the mansion of the perpetrator. But once inside, they find that the mansion is guarded by a pair of rabbits (Tewi and Reisen). The rabbits are defeated, but not before disorienting the team. Confused, the team must choose which path to take (one leads to the real moon and the other leads to the fake moon). After picking the right path, they are able to meet the perpetrator of this mischievous scheme, Kaguya. Kaguya is a moon princess in hiding who has taken the real moon in order to sever the link between the earth and the moon. The team restores the real moon and Kaguya challenges them to face the ""5 impossible requests.""",2004-08-15 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,70.6206,19

Reimu Hakurei and the others are currently having a feast every three days at the Hakurei shrine. During these feasts, a strange mist appears. The playable character decides to get the cause of the never-ending feast schedule and the mist. This incident was later called the ""Night Parade of One Hundred Oni Every Four Days"" by Aya Shameimaru in Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red.

The perpetrator of the incident is an oni, said to have disappeared from Gensokyo, named Suika Ibuki. She thought that it was a shame that the flower-viewing season had been cut short due to the very long winter. She spread herself out in the form of a mist all throughout Gensokyo, and ""gathered"" the hearts of both humans and youkai to cause them to have a feast every few days.

Because the art of oni extermination has been lost to Gensokyo, the girls could not eliminate her, but the mist disappeared afterwards and feasts started to happen less frequently.",2004-12-30 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

To assist in the rebuilding of the colonies by calming down enraged colonists, the Liandri Corporation came up with the idea of staging a gladiatorial tournament for the miners. The interest was so high that it grew into a sport, with sponsored teams battling in specially made arenas.

From the very beginning, Xan Kriegor, a robot, reigned as champion in the Tournament, until Malcolm, then leading the team Thunder Crash, defeated him and proceeded to merge with the other popular team at the time – the Iron Guard, led by Brock. In last year's tournament, they were defeated by the Juggernauts, led by gene-boosted monster Gorge.

The game takes place as the Tournament enters its 10th year, Malcolm is back with his old team Thunder Crash and trying to reclaim his title as champion, Brock is back with the Iron Guard and trying for the glory of his own and Gorge and the Juggernauts are there to defend their title. Additionally, the Skaarj Empire has sent a team of their own to the tournament in search of honor and glory and ex-champion Xan Kriegor has had some modifications and is back to return the title where it belongs.",2004-03-16 00:00:00.000,63,NULL,88.0000,3,83.0720,163

Assault on Blackwing Lair
Deep within Blackrock Mountain, the black dragon Nefarian conducted twisted experiments with the blood of other dragonflights. Intent on seizing the entire area for his own, he recruited the remaining Dark Horde, a rogue army that embraced the demonic bloodlust of the old Horde. These corrupt orcs, trolls, and other races battled against Ragnaros and the Dark Iron dwarves for control of the mountain. Nefarian created the twisted chromatic dragons and a legion of other aberrations in his bid to form an army powerful enough to control Azeroth and continue the legacy of his infamous father, Deathwing the Destroyer. Nefarian was vanquished by the heroes from the Horde and the Alliance.

Rise of the Blood God
Years ago, in the ruined temple of Atal'Hakkar, loyal priests of the Blood God Hakkar the Soulflayer attempted to summon the wrathful deity's avatar into the world. But his followers, the Atal'ai priesthood, discovered that the Soulflayer could only be summoned within the Gurubashi tribe's ancient capital, Zul'Gurub. Newly reborn in this jungle fortress, Hakkar took control of the Gurubashi tribe and mortal champions of the trolls' mighty animal gods. The Soulflayer's dark influence was halted when the Zandalari tribe recruited heroes and invaded Zul'Gurub.

The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj
The great desert fortress of Ahn'Qiraj, long sealed behind the Scarab Wall, was home to the insectoid qiraji, a savage race that had once mounted an assault to devastate the continent of Kalimdor. But something far more sinister lurked behind Ahn'Qiraj's walls: the Old God C'Thun, an ancient entity whose pervasive evil had suffused Azeroth since time immemorial. As C'Thun incited the qiraji to frenzy, both the Alliance and Horde prepared for a massive war effort. A mixed force of Alliance and Horde soldiers, dubbed the Might of Kalimdor, opened the gates of Ahn'Qiraj under the command of the orc Varok Saurfang. The heroes laid siege to the ruins and temples of Ahn'Qiraj and vanquished C'Thun.

Shadow of the Necropolis
In the Lich King's haste to spread the plague of undeath over Azeroth, he gifted one of his greatest servants, the lich Kel'Thuzad, with the flying citadel of Naxxramas, as a base of operations for the Scourge. Consistent attacks from the Scarlet Crusade and Argent Dawn factions weakened the defenses of the floating fortress, enabling an incursion from the heroes that led to Kel'Thuzad's defeat. However, a traitor among the ranks of the knightly order of the Argent Dawn ran away with Kel'Thuzad's cursed remains and fled to Northrend, where the fallen lich could be reanimated.",2004-11-23 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Che Yun was talented in the art of Mujia - a technique of creating and manipulating constructs of magnets and wooden machinery, which are lightweight yet powerful, with her late grandfather as her inspiration. She fashioned herself wooden prosthetic legs and managed to craft a lifelike and agile wooden fox that can be used in various tasks such as transportation and battle, Yunhu (雲狐), after much effort and coming across rare materials. She was a close friend with Huan Yuanzhi (桓遠之), whom Che Yun saved from drowning and who assisted her in creating Yunhu with exotic components. Che Yun later encountered Ying Shi (嬴詩) (who is reincarnation of Che Yun except that Ying was from a different era and was named Murong Shi - 慕容詩). With Che Yun as a common link, Huan and Ying formed a grudging alliance and adventured together, coming into conflicts with the Jin Kingdom's Tai Chen Gong, a priest organization focused on increasing its power and influence, and Heralds of the Seven Luminaries (七曜使者 ""Qiyao Shizhe""), a group of powerful rebels from a bleak future timeline sent back with the help of the student of the then-deceased Spirit of the Vessel. At the culmination of the story, Che, Ying and Huan reached the deepest chamber of the Realm of Haotian containing the wheel that determines the destiny of and relationship between all things, Wheel of Taiyi (太一之輪 ""Taiyi Zhi Lun""). However, Murong and Huan were both duty-bound to set history on diverging courses in favor of their homelands. Che intended to stop Huan from changing the future despite Murong having decided against intervening with history by ordering Yunhu to push Huan away. However, Huan wielded the Xuan-Yuan Sword and injured Che fatally by accident while repelling Yunhu. The gate to the Palace then closed abruptly. Murong, unable to extract her friends was transported out of the gate, leaving Huan and Che in the room where Huan, immortal due to the power of his surroundings, mourned in regret for a thousand years. At the instant of Che Yun's death, Murong realized their link and inherited the knowledge of Mujia. She entered the gate when it next opened in a thousand years after she returned to the future in which Jin overcame Qin to fight for the welfare of the common-folk, encountering a sorrowful aged Huan and offering forgiveness and acceptance as Che Yun would have.",2004-02-06 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

All we know for sure is that Madotsuki, the game's silent protagonist, lives alone in her apartment which she refuses to leave and which contains a desk, a single Famicom game console, a balcony, and, most importantly, a bed. Upon going to bed, Madotsuki explores her dreams, a surreal world full of illogically connected, smaller worlds to gather ""effects.""
